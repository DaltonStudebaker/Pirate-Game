You are a pirate and a merchant vessel has wandered into your hunting ground. Unfortunately your spotter has had too much rum and could only alert you to the trader's presence before passing out. Shoot your cannons into the sea near your ship in the hopes of hitting the traders without your drunk spotter. 
If we take too long to hit the merchant ships they will escape! Get shooting!
